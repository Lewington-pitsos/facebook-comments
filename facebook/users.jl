She then received a gas bill which was more than 200% higher than any of her previous bills, but I\u2019m being told that her bill is correct. While acti<span class=\"text_exposed_hide\">...</span><span class=\"text_exposed_show\">ng on her behalf, I\u2019ve been patient, polite and understanding. Everyone is busy, and it\u2019s sometimes difficult to get to the bottom of issues. Or it needs lots of time. I understand that. But to throw it back onto my mum is not going to work. I won\u2019t accept that, sorry. She is 77 years of age. Her gas bills are so consistent and predictable, and always paid well before the due date. Always. I\u2019m requesting that you look more carefully at her claim because the money is not an issue. I\u2019ll pay it in a heartbeat myself if it\u2019s correct. But the fact is, there was a gas leak outside of her home which was not her fault; was outside of her control, and she was not home to report it. Don\u2019t leave me no option other than engagement of the ombudsman. Please. Thank you.</span></p>", "timestamp": "18 August"}

I was read the whole script and then played the recording which I understand that you have to do.  But what is really annoying is that after I went through that whole process with the gas, I had to do it all again with the electricity.  I had to listen to the same recording and listen to the same script and answer the same questions, even though it was all on the one call.  I tried to tell the operator that it wasn't necessary to repeat everything again, but he insisted that he had to because if he didn't then he would fail his compliance.  I think Energy Australia need to re-evaluate their processes, because all you have managed to do it frustrate and annoy a new customer and I'm now considering exercising my right to cancel within the cooling off period because that's how much it annoyed me.</p>", "timestamp": "6 August"}

I hope to get lucky on Social Media. So here is the complain again:<br> 1) In December 2017, You promised me 31% Discount on my energy bill but it seems that has been conveniently forgotten until I called last Month &amp; you reinstated it to 32%. Your Customer Service Staff said he cannot retrospectively give me that di<span class=\"text_exposed_hide\">...</span><span class=\"text_exposed_show\">scount &amp; someone will call me back about it. Unfortunately I have not received any  calls to retrospectively give me discount. <br> 2) Last year you have been asking me to pay full amount because I am missing the payment deadline.

I have made numerous phone calls (local &amp; inters<span class=\"text_exposed_hide\">...</span><span class=\"text_exposed_show\">tate &amp; the phillipines) and on line chats with people who can't speak english and make textbook answers to questions. Ausgrid sent a technician who apparently is not authorised to work on the 'smart' meter WHICH NEEDS TO BE RECONFIGURED OR REPLACED OR WIRED IN PROPERLY TO HEAT THE WATER!! I have had the heater checked to be sure that the element and the thermostat are both in working order, so I am certain that the problem is with the power supply (ie LACK OF POWER)!! When you phone Energy Aust you never get to speak to anyone... there is just a never ending circle of fruitless options or referral to an unfriendly website or referral back the Ausgrid who are not authorised to work on the new meters. BE WARNED : ENERGY AUSTRALIA IS NO LONGER AUSTRALIAN OWNED AND THERE IS NO AFTERSALES SERVICE!

I have now gone to the ombudsman for help which i shouldn't have to! One phone call should have fixed this and issue that could have been fixed if someone 4 months ago did their job correctly. Now i am being punished because of their stuff up and they say to me \"we can't help you, we understand we made the mistake but your going to have to pay\".

I left my previous address on the 12th of December and you successfully froze my account until I moved into my new place in January. The changeover was made with one simple phone call and I was pretty impressed. My first bill for the new place arrived in January and I think \u201cawesome - I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s money in the account before the due date because the direct debit has just been transferred to the new address\u201d (that\u2019s what I<span class=\"text_exposed_hide\">...</span><span class=\"text_exposed_show\"> was told on the phone at the time of the transfer). Imagine my surprise when today (3 days after the bill was due), I still haven\u2019t seen the direct debit come out of my account. I log in online and sure enough \u201cno direct debit is setup\u201d for my account. I\u2019ve now set it up for my future bills but in the meantime you\u2019re going to charge me a fee for paying the existing bill by credit card (which should have been paid in advance via my existing direct debit arrangement). I hope you\u2019ll be crediting my account for the 0.36% fee you\u2019re charging me!</span></p>", "timestamp": "18 February"}

Finally sent my bill which i just received 3 days ago. What really makes me shake my head is the bill finally was issue on the 22.1.18 but was due on the 19.1.18 can you please explain how I was ever going to pay it in time. Oh that's right I had to chase you again on FB  to get you to move and send me a bill. Then to top it off you sent it to a debt collections. Your company has never be able to deliver a bill in the right time. If you are thinking of going with this company don't bother not worth the craziness that this company is. I did the right thing time and time again trying to get a paper bill from them. No one is able to solve a problem. Poor customer service.</p>", "timestamp": "1 February"}

So he had to write a note saying how i would like my bills emailed before the due date.  I find this to be a scam as you get a discount when you pay before the due  date and   im not getting the opportunity to get this discount  as im not receiving my bills before the due date.<br> I will be taking this further if you can not deliver my.next bill before the due date.

I only recently increased my direct debit after doing my own calculations, my current electricity bill is nearly half of the previous one and I have only been a customer for 7months so do not fit the criteria for a 12month review. So any reason your computers my have for increasing the amount is nothing more than a greedy money grab. I have now had to waste my time refusing this lovely New Years present from your company by phoning one of your representatives. Luckily they were able to correct your computers calculations. I hope that in the future that we do not need to do this again.</p>", "timestamp": "16 January"}

I also note that the fine print says I <span class=\"text_exposed_hide\">...</span><span class=\"text_exposed_show\">didn't receive the usual discount for paying on the due date, when in fact EA didn't debit the amount for several days after it was due!!!   The reason I am trying to access my account is to ensure my banking details are correct so that doesn't happen again.  I'm also not happy with the way the bill is itemised - it's at least $100 more than it should be and doesn't tell me whether it includes charges for moving homes or not and actually seems to go over the date I moved out of the service address and requested that power be switched off.

Since I didnt hear back from you I called you guys again today and I was told that I need to get an electrician and get the meter changed myself. I also had a conversation with one of your live chat staff and he said this information is wrong and the only people that can change the meter are the electricity distributors (I have the chat transcript). So I spoke to the distributor and they said meter changes are done by electricity retailers. Can someone please let me know how to get my meter changed so that I dont have to pay a $1000 bill to Energy Australia for a house where only 2 people live???</p>", "timestamp": "29 August 2017"}

For a few quarters I have been receiving ridiculous amounts on my bill which did not compute.  To me, the bill seemed too low to be correct but I kept paying it.  After a while I decided to ask a few people around that I know what their bills were and compared it to mine.  Yes, my bill definitely was not right.  I decided to call EA and told them the concern.  The customer rep lady stated that my bill looked right and there wa<span class=\"text_exposed_hide\">...</span><span class=\"text_exposed_show\">s nothing to worry about after I told her my type of usage.  But she said she would talk to the billing department to have a second set of eyes to look at the situation.   I was right, somehow when I moved to a new place when they transferred the energy usage from one place to another they only were charging me supply charges and not service charges.  Their proposition was that they will bill me for the last 9 months being 3 quarters and apply a discount if I paid it on time.   Now in the world of great customer service; if you as the company providing the service made an error on your side; would you not waive any charges for previous bills and start with a clean slate.  Personally I should have gone with another energy company as Energy Australia no longer appeals to me.  I know two people at work who have had similar issues with EA and there will be more complaints to the ombudsman issued shortly.  What happened to the good old days when everything was dealt with in Australia and there were no outsourced customer service operators.</span></p>", "timestamp": "28 August 2017"}

After moving into my apartment in December 2016 and then receiving my first bill in the new year, I had to query the service address because it listed me as being at a different address to where I actually lived. After numerous phone calls and being hung up on multiple times, you FINALLY came to the conclusion that I was being billed for a Shop in my building rather than at my Unit residential rate. I <span class=\"text_exposed_hide\">...</span><span class=\"text_exposed_show\">then started receiving bills for BOTH the Shop and the Unit. Again, numerous calls to clarify I should only be receiving 1 x bill, you 'cleared it up'. My relief in my belief that this ordeal was finally over and I would simply be able to pay a bill like normal was short lived. I soon received a notice addressed to 'the occupant' in the mail from Ausgrid that if my energy bill was not paid I would have my power turned off. Obviously surprised I phoned EnergyAustralia AGAIN and was reassured all was fine and it must have been delivered to the wrong address. So what happened? My power got switched off. I had been paying my bills against the Shop's meter number after all. That was a month ago, and guess what - we have power - but I am YET AGAIN receiving bills for BOTH addresses.

Then when I called your department was noti<span class=\"text_exposed_hide\">...</span><span class=\"text_exposed_show\">fied that the job wasn't put in on your end (so pretty much wasted half a day, when your team member told me it was all booked in) was then asked if I could wait another 5 hours and Energex would be out. Your team member apologised but said 'we've fixed the issue' and I left it at that. Meanwhile at 4pm I get a phone call saying that 'no power will be connected' at all today, and to rebook for another time. I have wasted an entire day waiting on your company, let alone this has left us literally in the dark.

After months of waiting, and calling again after hearing nothing (therefore having to explain the w<span class=\"text_exposed_hide\">...</span><span class=\"text_exposed_show\">hole situation to a new consultant each time) I got tired of it and spoke to the complaints department.

A few weeks before Christmas, I receive a call from a debt collector regarding the bill.

Or could you make your on hold message inclusive of expected time waits... then at least I know how many more minutes of my life I have to waste. <br> 2- I moved out of a residential address and into another. Really simple. I asked you to end both my electricity and gas at one residential and then turn on electricity at my new residential address (no gas required). Congratulations on managing to turn off my electricity as my <span class=\"text_exposed_hide\">...</span><span class=\"text_exposed_show\">previous address, however; you forgot to turn off my gas account... how, I don't understand. <br> 3- as I was set up on direct debit I continued paying off the gas as previous address even though I don't live there and ended up in credit (hooray hey?!)<br> 4- I contacted you via email as to not disrupt the phone lines anymore than they seem to be as my request was pretty bloody simple; end my gas account at previous address and transfer the credit to my current electricity account- SUPER SIMPLE, but apparently not. I received an email stating that the final metre read (that should have taken place with the electricity read 3 months ago by the way) would cost me... really?! I emailed back again, not happy as this was NOT my mistake; it was yours. I notified you of my move and tried to do the right thing and was assured by your staff this would be done- also, my old house mate set up accounts for both electricity and gas with you as soon as I cancelled and now there are TWO gas accounts for ONE address, how this happens is yet another mess you've made...- so your lovely sales assistant waived this and assured me that the metre would be read and I would be billed up until the 7th September 2016 (oh yes, all of this was supposed to happen in SEPTEMBER). <br> 5- today... you sent me A PAPER bill to MY old address (again; how you managed that I don't know as I have an account with you for my current address and told you I don't live at the old address and to send things to my new one-lucky my old housemate lives there otherwise I'd be waiting endlessly for a bill that I'd never receive) stating that the $182.97 credit that was on my bill, for an address I haven't been at for over 3 months is now $24. Why? Because you've done a BANG UP job of charging me for the past three months I have not lived there (well done)... so now I've paid a bill that isn't mine and I get nothing back. <br> The instructions I gave were simple, I provided dates of when I moved out- and even set up with you for my new address. And I'm really disappointed in the lacklustre level of service I have received from your end. This issue was simple, should be an easy fix but has been stuffed up again, and now I need to waste more of my time trying to contact you. </span></p>", "timestamp": "6 December 2016"}

Since early October I have made at least 8 phone calls to you. Initially I wanted to get power connected to my investment property between tenants so I can do some work on the property to get it ready for my new tenant. The first call apparently the operator failed to submit the request. I was told on the second call things were fine only to find out on the third call that as by that time my new tenant ha<span class=\"text_exposed_hide\">...</span><span class=\"text_exposed_show\">d also made a request (at my recomendation!), my request could now not be completed and I had to complete the work at my property by throwing an extension lead over the fence and using my neighbour's power. In the meantime I have had the plumber out twice to conduct a safety check and required maintenance on the gas heater (both times when you assure me the power would be connected) and had to send him away each time. And now I have an account set up for the investment property with a connection fee charged to it which I will not be paying. You have given me no power, incurred additional costs to me in relation to the plumber, endangered the lives of my tenants by not facilitating maintenance work on equipment in the house and when I finally got the name and extension of someone who appeared willing and capable of resolving this issue, and rang today to talk to him, I am told I cannot be put through to him and his extension even though he gave to me to use anytime purely due to the fact that he was horrifed and embarrassed by all I have experienced and wanted to ensure I could reach him anytime to get this matter resolved. I will not put my phone number on this post, and I regret having to put this negative feedback in a public forum but I am literally at my wits' end.

I called up again and was told you do not do special meter reads, so we had to wait for the next standard meter read and guess what, shock horror, still not swapped over. Currently on phone to a member of your \"helpful\" staff who has stated that our currently Gas provider declined the swapover which was a lie, cause the next person I spoke to stated that our account was deleted and we have to set up again. after 30 minutes of tedious repetition the call dropped and we had to go through it again. Apparently we're now getting a special meter read and getting swapped over on October 4th (which is odd, cause EA previously stated that special meter reads for gas do not exist) although I will not hold my breath. At this point I don't know why we're bothering. Thanks for everything, keep up the good work.

We went through the quote process and I was told I would have to either pay in full or pay a deposit before an appointment could be booked for a technician to come out and install the systems. <br> I happily paid the deposit. I wasn't willing to pay in full given I hadn't yet received the goods. Luckily I <span class=\"text_exposed_hide\">...</span><span class=\"text_exposed_show\">didn't!<br> I was told that day that someone would be in contact with me within one week to organise instalation.<br> Well that was Friday the 26th. I am still yet to hear from anyone.<br> I called Home Services again yesterday morning, I spoke to Constantino this time. I advised him of the situation and he seemed shocked that this had happened. He apologised and told me he couldn't see any reason as to why I have not yet received a call. He assured me that he had escalated my concern and I would be receiving a call shortly. He asked when I would like the appointment for.. I told him this week. <br> The tonw in his response made it sound like that's probably not going to happen.<br> He advised I would receive a call shortly to organise an appointment for this week however I wasn't convinced, but I thought I would give him the benefit of the doubt.<br> Given I called early morning yesterday, almost 2 days have passed and still no phone call.<br> I did advise Constantino that i require an appointment this week as shortly I will not be available to be at the property when the technician comes to install. This would mean it cannot be complete and I will have to cancel the quote and be refunded the deposit and you would lose the $3500 sale.<br> I do have other options, but at this point I really don't have the time to go elsewhere, however if this cannot be resolved ASAP, I will have no choice.<br> Last time I organised a split system, the appointment was booked that day. I'm assuming this process haa changed. As for some reason your staff are unable to organise appointments themselves and it seems like it's palmed off to someone external? Direct communication between the two would have been a less painful process for both the customer and your business.<br> Can someone please contact me to book this by close of business tomorrow? I require an appointment within a week at the latest. <br> Thank you.</span></p>", "timestamp": "30 August 2016"}

Whoever 'Hayley' is, she needs some serious lessons in how to deal with customers and doesn't deserve to be functioning in a case manager role if she can't be bothered to pick up the phone and make a call. My housemates and I are all teachers, we cannot pick up the phone during class and have asked for callbacks after 3:30pm. Not very hard guys!

As I'm due to receive a reading for this quarter I will now have to bills to pay within a week of each other through no fault of my own.     After finding no real sat<span class=\"text_exposed_hide\">...</span><span class=\"text_exposed_show\">isfaction with Customer Service I was put through to a rude Manager who although they apoligised still expected all bills be paid on time.  Again 15 minutes of run around with no answers and a case of yeah we know we are in the wrong but tough we won't do anything for you.   I asked so if I didn't ring how long until the mistake was caught 5,6,7, ,8 months?  The answer \" No we would have caught it\". When?  and when you do you slug customers with a huge bill because your systems failed!  Very poor customer service on your behalf ENERGY AUSTRALIA.  When said to the Manager that maybe I should look for another provider, her answer \"That's your prerogative\".  Yes you are correct Ms Manger and since that is your attitude towards  a Customer when you are at fault and treat me rudely I will exercise that prerogative and find a supplier that treats me with the dignity and respect that all customers deserve.

That's a few hours I need to be compensated for leaving work early. <span class=\"text_exposed_hide\">...</span><span class=\"text_exposed_show\">On top of all of this, I was told the my power would take 4 hours to turn on, leaving me at home on a Monday night without power - AGAIN. All up, I was inconvenienced from Saturday morning until Monday night 10pm. This is simply unacceptable that a huge company like this doesnt have support over the weekend. It is completely impracticle for a company of this size to only have phone support between 9am-5pm on week days. Very unhappy customer.</span></p>", "timestamp": "31 March 2016"}

I receive a letter saying that my gas meter will be replaced as a part of general upkeep or something, I had no issues with my meter at all.<br> A couple of weeks later we get a knock at the door, my partner answers it to a unkempt man who simply says I just changed your gas meter I need to come inside to relight your appliances.<br> No offering of of any identity , no politeness. My partner of cour<span class=\"text_exposed_hide\">...</span><span class=\"text_exposed_show\">se refused him entry, and he left.<br> I get home from work and am told what had happened and that i needed to relight the appliances, I go to the ducted gas heater and it is clicking away trying to relight itself, for god knows how long. this was the ONLY appliance I could relight, the hot water service wouldn't relight and the oven wouldn't work.<br> I call your company and after explaining the situation am told someone will call me as i need to give them access to the property.This could take up to 48 hrs!!!! ridiculous.<br> The next morning , without a phone call again, someone turns up.<br> Luckily my son was home to let him in, this man then proceeded to  break my plants accessing the hot water service, lit it and left, not sorting out the oven not lighting. If I was contacted as I was told was going to happen, I would have cleared easier access for him and the plants would not have been broken.<br> I then have to ring your company back, speak to 4 different people again, and once again am told \" this is not an emergency, we'll have someone out as soon as we can, but this happens when we do meter changes, sometimes appliances just dont restart, and you'll have to get a plumber to fix them. Not a very helpful response, if you didn't replace a meter that was working fine , nothing would be broken, everything would be working fine as it was ,I could have cooked my dinner last night and I could have had a shower this morning.<br> Overall I'm very disappointed in the professionalism of all of this from start to finish.

Through broken English we managed to have some correspondence where the gentleman informed me the supply had been plugged and would take <span class=\"text_exposed_hide\">...</span><span class=\"text_exposed_show\">48 hrs business days to just request any action. This means no hot water, stove or heating. Today is Tuesday 16th, awoke again to no gas, rang Energy Australia again to enquire what was going on with my situation. The gentleman told me a technician had been and the line wasn't plugged, I sad still no supply in my house so he arranged another technician to come today or tomorrow. Still not done today so best case scenario is tomorrow Wednesday 17th. I have children here and we will have had no hot water, stove or heating for 6 days with no guarantee the problem will be resolved tomorrow !!!!!  Do you think this is fair or appropriate service???  I can tell you as soon as (if) the gas is connected properly I will be changing suppliers and will be seeking further advice as to what I can do regarding the inconvenience your company has caused me.</span></p>", "timestamp": "15 February 2016"}

They apologized for the error and informed me that the request would not be processed. I was also advised that I had over paid an account when I was a customer back in October 2015 and was due a refund cheque. <br> A letter was then sent to<span class=\"text_exposed_hide\">...</span><span class=\"text_exposed_show\"> me by Energy Australia confirming the refund and asking that I complete the bottom section of the letter confirming my address etc and return for the refund. I have completed all of this and not received my refund.<br> On Tuesday 9 February 2016 I received a text message from Energy Australia advising me that my new account had been created and providing me with an account number 6677834158.<br> I called Energy Australia again to advise that I did not request this and the woman I spoke with was very rude and condescending stating that obviously I had requested the change and perhaps I forgot the conversation. Clearly I would remember having such a conversation and I can assure you that I have not \u201cforgot\u201d that I signed up with you. This woman proceeded to tell me that an external provider of yours was the one to send through the information to you that I wanted to move. This is an issue in itself as I did not request this however when I told this to your customer service representative, she proceeded to hang up on me.<br> I called back approximately 30 mins later and there was no record of my call on file. I proceeded to explain the situation again and was then told that I had completed an online request on 9 December 2015. On 9 December 2015 I was in Los Angeles and certainly wasn\u2019t completing any online requests with Energy Australia.<br> I have asked to have all my details removed from your system and not to be contacted by Energy Australia again and was advised this is not possible. <br> I understand you have no real interest in helping me as I have no intention of ever being an Energy Australia customer again but I need to understand how this has happened. I am concerned for my privacy and that this can happen. <br> I need to be assured that this won\u2019t happen again. I have informed Origin Energy of the situation and they will be requesting the account back.<br> I would like some kind of resolution and reassurance on this matter.

We spoke to you yesterday on his behalf with him there and you assured us that it<span class=\"text_exposed_hide\">...</span><span class=\"text_exposed_show\"> was the distributors issue and that everything had been sorted and 100% he would have his gas connected today. Imagine our surprise when we finish work and find out yet again you have let him down and he is still without gas to run his hot water service. This is simply not good enough, especially with 3 young kids. Apparently the issue lies with the service being blocked, assumedly because the previous customer didn't pay their bills, how this is now his issue makes no sense at all. You are required to establish a connection to an existing property within one business day of being given notice (prior to 3pm the day before) he signed up for a connection with you on Monday the 11th of January, please explain to me why this has not occurred and why you gave us a guarantee yesterday that it would be done today and it hasn't been.
